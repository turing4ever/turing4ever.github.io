A Thanksgiving escape to the Eastern Sierra. We packed up the car with our cat and dog and headed to Mammoth Lakes for a few days of mountain scenery, hot springs, and quality family time.

Both Lucy and Feynman behaved very well in the cramped space. Feynman showed great interest in the scenery and the driving experience. He frequently moved to the front seat to watch the view or sit in the driver's lap. 

## The Road Trip
Driving with both a cat and a dog in the car is always an adventure.

On a sunny day, the scenery at Convict Lake is breathtaking.

## Wild Willy's Hot Springs

There are several hot springs in the Mammoth Lakes area, but Wild Willy's is the best. Sitting in the running hot spring water feels amazing—the temperature is perfect. Warm, but not too hot.

## A Wallet Finds Its Way Back
The day before we left Mammoth Lakes, I took Ryan to Mammoth Mountain in a hurry. When I got back to the hotel, I couldn't find my wallet. Just then, my wife's phone rang. Someone asked if she was with me. I took her phone and talked to the guy—he told me where to meet him and returned my wallet.

I never asked how he found my wife's number. I had a note with my own phone number in the wallet, but nothing with hers. How did he find her number, and why didn't he call me directly? It's a puzzle I still can't figure out.
