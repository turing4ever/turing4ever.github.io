> **So this is what this book is about -- that dream, the first forty, those years "whose margins fade for ever and forever" as we move. As a young man I never 
> understood what the beautiful phrase from Tennyson meant. That was the one thought in the whole beautiful poem "Ulysses" that eluded my grasp. Now I know why.**



> **Many people tell me time is the most valuable possession we have. I'm not sure I agree, because no story is ever straight. In traversing our life from youth
> to old age, we truly live outside time. There are certain ordinary moments, and then there are highlights that your consciousness treasures forever. Some good
> and some horrible moments, but indelible. And for me at least, trying to get from cradle to grave is too long a time, too much happens, too many characters to 
> cherish, too much forgotten or remembered falsely. Baby steps are required to understand these moments outside time and what they mean. That's the greatest pleasure
> I take in writing -- re-appreciating, loving all over again.**
