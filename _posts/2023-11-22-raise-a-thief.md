> **There is NOT always a happy ending**

In American movies, there is always a happy ending. The hero saves the world and reunites with his sweetheart. 
In Russian movies, heroes die, but life goes on. Maybe different history does give people different presumption about life and world. 
With only 200 years of mostly peaceful history, Americans are optimistic at heart. Russians with their traumatic memories think differently. 
The author is a Russian American and I guess he brought both perspectives into the book. There's no happy ending in the book, but he did put some sugar coating on it 
for his American readers. 

> **Everyone is broken**

This book is about parenting children with special needs: a son with autism and a daughter with RAD(Reactive Attachment Disorder). It is a tough journey as the author
and his wife struggle to raise their children. As the story unfolds, the author also offers a lot of introspection into his and his wife's childhood. The damages and struggles 
in their own life also comes to play in their parenting. He also extrapolates: maybe everyone is broken in some way. 

I can't agree more. Everyone has his own struggle. Sometimes, it's more open, sometimes, it's more hidden. Some more severe, others less so. 
It's the fundamental reality of human experience.


> **Life has a grim face**

There are insurmountable obstacles in life. They can be unjustified, unexplainable and cruel. Yet, you will have to face them and figure out a way to carry on. 
The author and his wife turned the page and moved beyond the dark chapters. I admire their courage and strength and feel happy for them.
