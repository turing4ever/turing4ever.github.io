It has been a while since the last time we were in New York city. Dropping ourselves from a suburban town into the forest of skyscrapers, 
we were quite overwhelmed by the filth, the smell, the noise and the hustle on the streets. But Ryan really enjoyed the city vibe and it was his first visit.

## The Performance
The main mission of the trip was Ryan's piano performance. He participated the competition online and won the opportunity to perform in New York. 
Since he has never been to New York before, why not?
### Waiting at the back stage

We were all nervous when Ryan walked to the piano. Judging by his stiff facial expression, he was probably on auto-pilot with all the muscle memory. 
He finished the whole thing smoothly: walk to the piano, bow to the audience, Sweet Dreams by Tchaikovsky without any interruption,
bow to the audience again and then walk out. Despite a couple of mistakes on the notes, he delivered it. 
It was a concert for the kids, the oldest ones were probably in high school. The small kids, just like Ryan, were all very nervous. Probably all of them performed for the first 
time on a big stage. Older kids were definitely more comfortable on the stage. Some of them really carried themselves with grace and connected with the audience. 
I hope a few years later Ryan can be as impressive as them. 
### All the wonderful kids
