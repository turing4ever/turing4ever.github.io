We have been visiting Mt Baldy and hiking on the trail for a while. But each time we stopped somewhere not very far from the trail head.
This time, we made up our mind to finish the trail. Booked an Airbnb at the foot of Mt Baldy, we stayed there for one night and went on hiking the next day.
The total length of the trail is about 10 miles, with an elevation gain of 2,500 feet. It took us about 6 hours to finish the hike, including many breaks and lunch on the trail.

## After the hike 
Back at home, wife and I both feel exhausted and sore everywhere. But Ryan feels totally fine, possibly with minor soreness on his legs. But it doesn't bother him at all. 
The biggest surprise was that Lucy collapsed. Her rear legs can barely support her weight and she seems completely exhausted. 
On the trail, we already noticed her difficulty in walking in the last portion of the trail. But we only realized how bad it was until we were home. 
Then I googled, Google told me GSD can typically hike 3~5 miles without any problem. But it would take some training for a GSD to go 10 or more miles. 
I think we really pushed Lucy beyond her limit this time. I pray that she will have a good rest in the next few days and recover soon.
