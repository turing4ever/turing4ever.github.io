When I crawled through tubes, wires and circuits,  
mini lightnings went through my body.  
I was fine but you were mad.  
Since then you called me bug.  

So be it.  
I never steal or lie.  
My morals are impeccable.  
I only flip zeros and ones,  
like knocking out bowling pins.  
How can I resist the fun?  

I make my nest meticulously,  
as any good bug would do.  
Mostly with ifs, elses, and fors.  
But only through your hands.  
I whisper to your ears,  
in an assuring tone:  
this should work.  

I love hide and seek.  
When the night is deep and snails are out,  
there’s just you and me.  
Hopping from server to server, repo to repo,  
I mark my trail like a snail does.  
Don’t say that I am not nice to you!  

I almost wanted to caress your cheek,  
like your Mom did when you were a baby.  
For the serious look on your face each time you see me.  
As if you discovered the ants nest for the first time.  
As if you gazed into the constellations on the summit of Maunakea.  

But the game is not over yet:  
catch me if you can!
