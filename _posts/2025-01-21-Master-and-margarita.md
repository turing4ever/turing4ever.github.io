The Master and Margarita (Мастер и Маргарита) is a novel by Mikhail Bulgakov, written between 1928 and 1940 but not published until 1967. 
I first learnt about this book in some Jordan Peterson's remarks. 
But finally picked it up during Christmas break 2024. 
Halfway through it, I was lost: why the hell do you want to tell me those? What's your point?
And quickly when I approached the ending chapters, I was hooked, like a hopeless fish. 
When I put down the book, I know there's something twisted in the plot, but not 100% sure on how to decipher it. 

I need to read it again.
