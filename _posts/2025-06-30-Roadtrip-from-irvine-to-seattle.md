    - "2025 Roadtrip from Irvine to Seattle"

We drove 3 days from Irvine to Seattle, stopping at Vegas and Idaho along the way. Because we are in a rush, we didn't stop at any attractions.
But the trip still brought us some surprises.

## The Map

## Ready to go    
- Lucy and Feynman are ready to go

## Peace in the backseat 
We were very worried that Lucy and Feynman wouldn't get along in the car. Silly Lucy often chases Feynman at home, and Feynman would hiss at her.
They never get into real fights, but still they can make a scene. If that happens in the car on the highway, it would become a problem. Surprisingly, the cat, dog and kid got along very well in the backseat.

## Boise Farm 
- We met a lot of animals on the farm. Ryan was very happy.

- Curious Feynman.  
  He was curious once he arrived at the farm. In the photos, he was patrolling the house.

- An old fridge.  
  I have never seen such a refrigerator except in movies. I suspect it's older than me. And it even works!

## Everything works out in the end
- We arrived in Seattle safely.  
At one point, we almost got into trouble. One our way to Seattle, we left the farm in the morning. 
After getting up, Ryan has been hanging out with the animals, and he gets into the car in the last minute. 
Only half an hour later, Ryan told us he needs to go to the bathroom and it was urgent. So we stopped at a big gas station. 
While Ryan going to the bathroom, something weird happened. The car complained the key fab was not in the car. The battery of the key fab was dead. 
While I was not sure what to do, wife came up with a brilliant idea: turn off the car and turn it back on. 
I turned off the car, and it wouldn't start again. Of course not, the battery of the key fab was dead. What do I do now? 
It would be really unfortunate if we got stuck in the middle of nowhere. I removed the silver oxide battery from the key fab, and went to look for a new battery to buy in the store.
To my surprise, the store had the exact battery I needed. Problem solved.   
I told Ryan: you are a blessing to us, do you know that? If you didn't spend too much time with the animals, you wouldn't forget to pee before we left the farm.
If you didn't need to pee, we wouldn't stop at this gas station. If we didn't stop at this gas station, we wouldn't be so close to the new battery when the old one died. 
With you being you, everything works out for us in the end.
