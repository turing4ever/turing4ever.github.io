Today we went hiking on [Ice House Canyon Trail](https://goo.gl/maps/4KyvYVwSyv1LiqvAA) in Mt Baldy.   

I don't remember how many times we have been there. The last visit was in February when it just snowed in the mountain. 
But today we hiked the longest: round trip 4 miles. I know, I know, it's not impressive at all. 
But considering it's up the hill in one way with a nine year old kid and a dog, we made huge progress. With boosts from a bottle of coke, 
constant encouragements and fitbit monitoring the steps and progress, even Ryan managed to drag himself along.  

The entire trail is 9.8 miles, someday we will finish the whole thing.
