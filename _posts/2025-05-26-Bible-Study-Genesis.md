This is not a summary of Genesis, nor a review. Instead, it is a marker for the beginning of my journey into the Bible.  

## Why did I start reading the Bible?
There are many reasons. When I was a little child, I love sitting next to my Dad and listening to the adults' conversations. My Dad was a middle school teacher, and most of his friends 
were teachers too. The conversation ranged from the school related stuff to history, to politics, and anything in between. That was usually a feast for my ears. 
Anything they talked about was fascinating to me. I was hungry for knowledge and wisdom. 

And that yearning has been with me all the time. But I wasn't always lucky enough to sit next to a circle of adults that I can look up to, and they don't mind my eavesdropping.
With a blink of an eye, I became someone else's Dad while I am still the kid carrying his stool, searching for a perfect spot to sit down and listen.

I sent my son to a Christian school, and during one teachers' appreciation week, I bought a set of C.S Lewis' books for the teacher as a gift. 
At the same time, I bought an extra set for myself, thinking if she is so into C.S Lewis, there might be something interesting. 
But I didn't start reading them, and they sat on my shelf collecting dust for several years. Until one day, one co-worker revealed that he is a Christian and recommended C.S Lewis' Mere Christianity.
Funny enough, I remembered that the book was just sitting on my shelf, so I started reading it. 

It was a perfect entry point for me with great timing. For I became old enough to appreciate the topics in the book. I still remember about 18 years when I was doing my internship in the Bay Area, 
one co-worker was a Christian and brought me to his church. I was sitting in the front row and almost fell asleep during the sermon. I was too young to hear any of the messages. 
But now at mid-age, more experienced in life, I am able to hear it. And C.S Lewis did a great job giving a summary of what Christianity is.     

I believe we all live in the story we created for ourselves. If the Bible is the greatest story ever told, then why shouldn't copy and paste some of it into my own story?
I looked for local churches for a Bible study group and found one very close to my home. So far, the experiences were great. I go to Church every Sunday, 
read a few pages of the Bible every day, and attend the study group on Friday. 

Not trying to convert myself, but at least, I can plough through the Bible and become well versed in a few years.

## What do I think of Genesis?

There are many great stories in Genesis. I don't think I fully understand them yet, but that's not the point right now. The point is to read the book cover to cover. 
I think the content will sink in overtime.


## A few comments 
There are so many online sermons and commentaries about Genesis, but I think the open class from Hillsdale College is pretty good. 
It offers many insights but stays very concise. https://online.hillsdale.edu/courses/promo/genesis And it also gives quiz after each chapter. 

Hillsdale college Genesis course used a lot of classical art to illustrate the stories in Genesis. It led me to search for more. If you really think about it, in 2000 years,
the Bible inspired many great artists, musicians, and writers. Their works can bring additional flavors to the words in the Bible. For example, I found the following paintings 
about two chapters of Genesis.
