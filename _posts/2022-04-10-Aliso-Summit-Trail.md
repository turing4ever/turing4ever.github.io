We went hiking on the [Aliso Summit Trail](https://www.google.com/search?q=aliso+summit+trail&newwindow=1&client=firefox-b-1-d&biw=1440&bih=762&tbm=lcl&sxsrf=APq-WBt7BsveEzPtI5YlBzKN7_TVMgsFYA%3A1649657725208&ei=fcdTYqitDPPTkPIP9rW3yAc&oq=Aliso+summit+&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0i512k1l3j0i512i457k1j0i512k1.8687.10687.0.12308.13.9.0.4.4.0.119.684.4j3.7.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..2.11.698...0i67k1j0i273k1j0i512i433i131k1j0i512i433k1j0i433i131i67k1j0i433i67k1.0.HeLqbFy2Z7g#rlfi=hd:;si:767575213956875394,l,ChJhbGlzbyBzdW1taXQgdHJhaWxIpontyZWrgIAIWiAQABABEAIYABgBGAIiEmFsaXNvIHN1bW1pdCB0cmFpbJIBBHBhcms,y,bQro1Q-wFhM;mv:[[33.53145904243801,-117.70966008447263],[33.5103858918402,-117.75343373559568],null,[33.52092310890073,-117.73154691003415],15]) today.   


This is one of our go-to places when we really want to go hiking on a sunny summer day but want to avoid the heat. Because the trail is on the top of the hill, you will not only get great view of the pacific ocean but also the cool air. Lucy definitely appreciates that because she can get overheated very quickly.   


It's cloudy today, so we missed the great view of the ocean. After the hike, we went to Popeyes for lunch. Junk food after hiking = less guilt. :)
