Lucy, our German shepherd was born on October 31, 2020, one of 6 puppies from Nana vom Hauswalder Bach and Whillo vom Klostermoor. Whillo the Dad stayed in Germany while Nana the Mom was imported into US and gave birth to a litter in southern California. Almost one year into the pandemic, I was so desperately looking for a dog to keep myself physically active that I got the last spot on the waiting list of Nana and Whillo's litter. I guess I didn't pick Lucy, it's fate that chose Lucy for me. She has been such a blessing and brought so much joy to everyone in the family, I feel obliged to write something down for the first year of our shared memory.

# Ears standing up
German Shepherds usually have their ears standing up in 4-5 months. The funny thing was Lucy's ears stood up quite early. A few weeks later one ear fell.
A week later, the fallen ear stood up and the other one fell. And later both of them fell. I was quite worried about those fallen ears until a couple of months later they both stood up permanently.

# Curiosity 
Lucy is usually very curious about her surroundings and when she feels curious about something she will tilt her head and stare at it.
For example, if you try to talk to her, she will give you her full attention and tilt her head, staring at you and listening to you.
It's very cute.

# Lucy loves Ryan
There's some magical bond between Lucy and my son Ryan. I don't know what Ryan is in her eyes, but she is super protective and loyal to him. 
When we are on the hiking trail, she will make sure Ryan is in her sight. If Ryan is falling behind, she will halt and wait for him. Even if I pull the leash, she will refuse to go until Ryan is with her. Despite all the naughty things Ryan has done to her, Lucy's devotion to him is still 100%. That's just unbelievable!

# Next decade of joy and fun
A healthy German shepherd usually has a life span of 10 to 15 years. We are so blessed with such a sweet girl and looking forward to next decade of joy and fun with her.
