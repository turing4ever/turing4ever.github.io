The traffic flows calmly through the boulevard.  
On the banks are the trees, tall and green.   
The purple jumps out and takes over above the windshield.   
Vibrant and fresh, full of life.   
The banners of summer.  
In the car, he is telling the Samaritan woman:  
he has living water.   
Wait, is the living water purple?  


> **Driving on Jeffrey Boulevard in June, Jacaranda trees are blooming in purple. 
I was listening to a podcast about the conversation between Jesus and the Samaritan woman at Jacob's well. John 4:1-42**
