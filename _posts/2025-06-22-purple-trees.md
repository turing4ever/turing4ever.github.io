The traffic flows calmly through the boulevard.  
On both banks are the tall and green trees.   
The purple waterfall pours down above the windshield.   
Vibrant, fresh, full of life.   
Whose royal color is that?  
In the car, he is telling the Samaritan woman:  
I have the living water.   
Wait, is the living water purple?  


> **Driving on Jeffrey Boulevard in June, Jacaranda trees are blooming in purple. 
I was listening to a podcast about the conversation between Jesus and the Samaritan woman at Jacob's well. John 4:1-42**
