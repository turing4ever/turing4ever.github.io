    - "purple trees"

The traffic flows calmly through the boulevard.
On the banks are the trees, tall and green. 
All of sudden, the purple takes over my eyes. 
Vibrant and fresh, full of life. 
They are the banners of summer.
From the podcast, he says he has living water. 
Is the living water purple?
