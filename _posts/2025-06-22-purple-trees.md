The traffic flows calmly through the boulevard.  
On the banks are the trees, tall and green.   
All of sudden, the purple takes over my eyes.   
Vibrant and fresh, full of life.   
They are the banners of summer.  
He told the Samaritan woman that he has living water.   
Is the living water purple?  


> **Driving on Jeffrey Boulevard in June, Jacaranda trees are blooming in purple. 
I was listening to a podcast about the conversation between Jesus and the Samaritan woman at Jacob's well**
