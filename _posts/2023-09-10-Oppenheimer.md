> **A life of a genius**

Neither the book nor the movie Oppenheimer has done the justice for the life of a genius. 
Maybe the genius is as hard to decipher as quantum physics, the author of the book and movie scripts failed to understand him.
Because to understand is to judge. With all facts and complexities of Oppenheimer's life, the author not only has to reconstruct 
the space, the time and the chain of events. But he also has to find the perspective, putting the figure into the proper position 
on the stage. To achieve that, the author needs to weigh Oppenheimer's life, see through his soul, and deliver the final verdict.
The author tried to but lost the verdict.
