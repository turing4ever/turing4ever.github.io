> **A life of a genius**

I read the book and watched the movie. Neither the book nor the movie Oppenheimer has done the justice for the life of a genius. 
Maybe Oppenheimer is as hard to decipher as quantum physics, the author failed to understand him.
Because to understand is to judge. With all facts and complexities of Oppenheimer's life, the author not only has to reconstruct 
the chain of events. But he also has to build the perspective, putting all the elements into the proper place, 
and choose the defining moments, leaving everything else out. The burden is on the author to filter, to assess, to weigh and to pick.   
The author misunderstood his mission.
