    - "2025 Banff Roadtrip"
---
It's the longest and most ambitious road trip we have ever done. A month and a half of adventure across the Pacific Northwest and Canadian Rockies, with family, pets, and countless memories along the way. We worked for two weeks in Seattle, spent 10 days driving to Banff and exploring the Canadian Rockies, came back to Seattle. Worked another two weeks in Seattle enjoying the summer activities, and then drove back to Irvine. I forgot to take a photo of the odometer, but I think we drove 5000+ miles across multiple states and provinces.

## The Map

## Journey Through the Wilderness
The drive itself was an adventure. From Irvine, we made our way north through Washington, then east through Idaho and into Montana before crossing into Canada for our main destination: Banff National Park. Our return journey took us through Vancouver, then south to Seattle for our extended summer stay, and finally back to Irvine via Portland.

### Coeur d'Alene Wildlife Encounter
Our first major stop was in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. We stumbled upon an unexpected wildlife viewing opportunity right in a residential area. A family of deer had made themselves comfortable, completely unfazed by our presence.

### Seven Stars Alpaca Ranch
Still in the Coeur d'Alene area, we discovered Seven Stars Alpaca Ranch. 

![Ryan and Goat](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/seven_stars_alpaca_ranch_Ryan_saying_hello_to_goat.jpg)
Ryan immediately made friends with this curious goat. The animals at the ranch were incredibly friendly and well-socialized.

![Alpacas](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/seven_stars_alpaca_ranch_alpacas.jpg)
The alpacas were the stars of the show. Their fluffy coats and curious expressions won our hearts immediately.

## Going to the Sun Road - Glacier National Park
From Idaho, we continued into Montana where the highlight of our mountain driving was definitely the Going to the Sun Road in Glacier National Park. 

![Forest Road](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/going_to_the_sun_road_in_the_forest.jpg)
The road through the forest felt like driving into a fairy tale.

![Into the Clouds](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/going_to_the_sun_into_the_clouds_0.jpg)
As we gained elevation, we literally drove into the clouds.

![Misty Mountains](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/going_to_the_sun_into_the_clouds_3.jpg)
The road conditions changed dramatically as we climbed higher. Sometimes we couldn't see more than 50 feet ahead due to the thick mountain mist.

![Mountain Overview](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/going_to_the_sun_overview.jpg)
When the clouds cleared, the views were absolutely breathtaking.

## Banff National Park - The Crown Jewel
After Montana, we crossed into Canada and reached our main destination: Banff National Park.

### Banff Town and Highway Adventures

![E-bike Tour Elk 2](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/banff_canmore_ebike_tour_elk_2.jpg)
Our e-bike tour in Canmore led to incredible wildlife encounters - these elk were completely unfazed by our presence.

![Ryan Riding Bike](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/banff_canmore_ryan_riding_bike.jpg)
Ryan loved the e-bike adventure, exploring trails that would have been too challenging on regular bikes.

### Glacial Wonders
![Athabasca Glacier](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/banff_athabasca_glacier_you_need_apc_to_get_on_the_glacier.jpg)
The Athabasca Glacier was a highlight of our Banff experience. You need an APC (All-terrain Vehicle) to actually get on the glacier safely, which made the experience even more adventurous.

![Ryan Looking at Glacier](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/banff_jasper_ryan_look_at_the_glacier.jpg)
Ryan was awestruck standing before these ancient ice formations. The scale of the glaciers is impossible to capture in photos - you have to experience it in person.

## White Rock & Vancouver Area
From Banff, we made our way to the White Rock area near Vancouver. It was a very cozy little town. 

![White Rock Waterfront](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/white_rock_by_the_water.jpg)
The peaceful waterfront provided a stark contrast to the rugged mountains we'd been exploring.

![Street Walking](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/white_rock_walking_on_the_street.jpg)
![Lucy on the Floor](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/white_rock_lucy_on_the_floor.jpg)
Even Lucy enjoyed the change of pace. 

![White Rock Zero Avenue](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/white_rock_0_ave.jpg)
We found 0 Avenue. The city planner must have majored in CS. 

![Chinese Restaurant](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/white_rock_Richmond_chinese_restaurant_dog_head.jpg)
THere's only one reason why we wanted to visit Vancouver: the chinese restaurants.  *The food reminded us of home, and even this friendly restaurant dog seemed to welcome us.* (Cursor wrote this sentence and it's too funny to change it.)

## Seattle Summer Adventures
After our Banff expedition, we spent several weeks in Seattle, taking full advantage of the Pacific Northwest summer.

### Mountain Hiking Adventures
![Jim Whittaker Trail](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/jim_whittaker_wilderness_peak_trai.jpeg)
We tackled the Jim Whittaker Wilderness Peak Trail - one of our more challenging hikes of the summer.

![Mt. Rainier](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/mt_rainier.jpeg)
The views of Mt. Rainier never get old. Every angle offers a different perspective of this majestic mountain.


### Diablo Lake Vista

![Diablo Lake Vista 3](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/diablo_lake_vista_point_3.jpeg)
The turquoise waters of Diablo Lake are otherworldly. The unique color comes from glacial flour suspended in the water.

### Union Bay Canoeing with Lucy
We spent many peaceful mornings canoeing in Union Bay, and Lucy became quite the accomplished canoe companion.

![Union Bay Morning](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/lake_lucy_majestic.jpeg)
The serene beauty of Union Bay on a calm morning provided the perfect setting for family canoeing adventures.

![Lucy Looking at Geese](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/lake_lucy_looking_at_gees.jpg)
Lucy was fascinated by the local wildlife, especially these confident geese who seemed just as curious about her.

![Lucy Watching Other Canoe](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/lake_lucy_staring_at_other_canoe.jpg)
Lucy always kept a watchful eye on other watercraft - she took her role as our canoe security very seriously.

![Light Reflection on Water](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/lake_canoe_light_reflection_on_lake.jpg)
The way light danced on the water during our Union Bay paddling adventures created magical moments throughout our Seattle summer.

![Mt. Rainier Lake](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/lake_mt_rainier.jpeg)
When the sky is clear, you can see Mt Rainier from the Union Bay

### Olympic Peninsula Exploration
![Olympic Peabody Creek](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/olympic_peabody_creek_loop.jpeg)
The Peabody Creek Loop offered us a perfect introduction to the Olympic Peninsula's diverse ecosystems.

![Summer Camp 3](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/summer_camp_3 Large.jpeg)
Ryan attended summer camp in Seattle, making new friends and trying activities he'd never experienced before.

## Feynman's Adventures
Our cat Feynman proved to be quite the traveler, though he had his own way of experiencing the journey.

![Feynman Corner](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/pets_feynmann_corner.jpeg)
Feynman found his favorite corner in every place we stayed.

![Feynman Fled to Tree](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/pets_feymann_fled_to_tree.jpeg)
Sometimes the outdoor adventures were a bit overwhelming for our indoor cat, and he'd seek refuge in the nearest tree.

![Unspoken Bond](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/pets_so_much_unspoken_between_them.jpeg)
Despite their occasional squabbles at home, Lucy and Feynman developed a deeper understanding during this extended trip. There was so much unspoken communication between them.

## Portland Detour
On our way back, we couldn't resist a quick detour through Portland.

![Wahkeena Falls](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/portlan_wahkeena_falls.jpg)
Wahkeena Falls provided the perfect opportunity to stretch our legs and experience Oregon's natural beauty.

## Our Trusty Travel Companion
![Mercedes in the Mountains](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/going_to_the_sun_glc300.jpg)
Our Mercedes GLC 300 was the unsung hero of this entire adventure. When we started the trip, the odometer read around 68,000 miles. By the time we pulled back into our driveway in Irvine, we had reached 73,000 miles - a testament to the 5,000+ miles we covered across multiple states and provinces.
