---
It's the longest road trip we have ever done. A month and a half of adventure across the Pacific Northwest and Canadian Rockies, with family, pets, and countless memories along the way.

## The Map
This is the most ambitious road trip we have ever done. It took us a month and half to complete it.
We worked for two weeks in Seattle, spent 10 days driving to Banff and exploring the Canadian Rockies, came back to Seattle. Worked another two weeks in Seattle enjoying the summer activities, and then drove back to Irvine. I forgot to take a photo of the odometer, but I think we drove 5000+ miles across multiple states and provinces.

## Journey Through the Wilderness
The drive itself was an adventure. From Irvine, we made our way north through Washington, then east through Idaho and into Montana before crossing into Canada for our main destination: Banff National Park. Our return journey took us through Vancouver, then south to Seattle for our extended summer stay, and finally back to Irvine via Portland.

### Coeur d'Alene Wildlife Encounter
Our first major stop was in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. We stumbled upon an unexpected wildlife viewing opportunity right in a residential area. A family of deer had made themselves comfortable, completely unfazed by our presence.

The whole family enjoying their peaceful afternoon. Ryan was absolutely mesmerized - he had never seen deer so close and so relaxed around humans.

### Seven Stars Alpaca Ranch
Still in the Coeur d'Alene area, we discovered Seven Stars Alpaca Ranch. This wasn't planned, but sometimes the best adventures are the spontaneous ones.

![Ryan and Goat](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/seven_stars_alpaca_ranch_Ryan_saying_hello_to_goat.jpg)
Ryan immediately made friends with this curious goat. The animals at the ranch were incredibly friendly and well-socialized.

![Alpacas](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/seven_stars_alpaca_ranch_alpacas.jpg)
The alpacas were the stars of the show. Their fluffy coats and curious expressions won our hearts immediately.

## Going to the Sun Road - Glacier National Park
From Idaho, we continued into Montana where the highlight of our mountain driving was definitely the Going to the Sun Road in Glacier National Park. This engineering marvel winds through some of the most spectacular scenery in North America.

![Forest Road](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/going_to_the_sun_road_in_the_forest.jpg)
The road through the forest felt like driving into a fairy tale.

![Into the Clouds](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/going_to_the_sun_into_the_clouds_0.jpg)
As we gained elevation, we literally drove into the clouds.

![Misty Mountains](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/going_to_the_sun_into_the_clouds_3.jpg)
The road conditions changed dramatically as we climbed higher. Sometimes we couldn't see more than 50 feet ahead due to the thick mountain mist.

![Mountain Overview](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/going_to_the_sun_overview.jpg)
When the clouds cleared, the views were absolutely breathtaking.

## Banff National Park - The Crown Jewel
After Montana, we crossed into Canada and reached our main destination: Banff National Park. The Canadian Rockies exceeded all our expectations.

### Banff Town and Highway Adventures
![Banff Town Center](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/banff_town_center_word.jpg)
The charming town of Banff served as our home base for exploring the park.

Wildlife sightings were common - this majestic ram posed for us right along the highway.

![Chihuahua State Sign](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/banff_highway_chihuahua_state.jpg)
We found this amusing road sign - apparently we were as far from Mexico as you can get!

### Lake Louise - The Jewel of the Rockies
![Lake Louise Overview](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/banff_lake_louise.jpg)
Lake Louise is perhaps the most famous lake in Banff, and it lived up to every expectation.

Our e-bike tour in Canmore led to incredible wildlife encounters - these elk were completely unfazed by our presence.

![Ryan Riding Bike](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/banff_canmore_ryan_riding_bike.jpg)
Ryan loved the e-bike adventure, exploring trails that would have been too challenging on regular bikes.

### Glacial Wonders
![Athabasca Glacier](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/banff_athabasca_glacier_you_need_apc_to_get_on_the_glacier.jpg)
The Athabasca Glacier was a highlight of our Banff experience. You need an APC (All-terrain Vehicle) to actually get on the glacier safely, which made the experience even more adventurous.

![Ryan Looking at Glacier](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/banff_jasper_ryan_look_at_the_glacier.jpg)
Ryan was awestruck standing before these ancient ice formations. The scale of the glaciers is impossible to capture in photos - you have to experience it in person.

## White Rock & Vancouver Area
From Banff, we made our way to the White Rock area near Vancouver. It was a perfect way to ease back into city life after all that mountain wilderness.

![White Rock Waterfront](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/white_rock_by_the_water.jpg)
The peaceful waterfront provided a stark contrast to the rugged mountains we'd been exploring.

![Street Walking](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/white_rock_walking_on_the_street.jpg)
![Lucy on the Floor](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/white_rock_lucy_on_the_floor.jpg)
Even Lucy enjoyed the change of pace. She seemed to appreciate being back in a more urban environment.

![White Rock Zero Avenue](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/white_rock_0_ave.jpg)
One interesting discovery we made was that White Rock numbers its streets starting from 0 Avenue. We found this quite unusual - most cities start their street numbering from 1st. It's one of those small urban planning details that you only notice when you're paying attention.

![Chinese Restaurant](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/white_rock_Richmond_chinese_restaurant_dog_head.jpg)
We found an excellent Chinese restaurant in Richmond. The food reminded us of home, and even this friendly restaurant dog seemed to welcome us.

## Seattle Summer Adventures
After our Banff expedition, we spent several weeks in Seattle, taking full advantage of the Pacific Northwest summer.

### Mountain Hiking Adventures
![Jim Whittaker Trail](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/jim_whittaker_wilderness_peak_trai.jpeg)
We tackled the Jim Whittaker Wilderness Peak Trail - one of our more challenging hikes of the summer.

![Mt. Rainier](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/mt_rainier.jpeg)
The views of Mt. Rainier never get old. Every angle offers a different perspective of this majestic mountain.

![Mt. Rainier Lake](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/lake_mt_rainier Large.jpeg)
Finding a lake with Mt. Rainier reflected in the water felt like discovering a hidden gem.

![Diablo Lake Vista 3](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/diablo_lake_vista_point_3.jpeg)
The turquoise waters of Diablo Lake are otherworldly. The unique color comes from glacial flour suspended in the water.

### Union Bay Canoeing with Lucy
We spent many peaceful mornings canoeing in Union Bay, and Lucy became quite the accomplished canoe companion.

![Union Bay Morning](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/lake_lucy_majestic.jpeg)
The serene beauty of Union Bay on a calm morning provided the perfect setting for family canoeing adventures.

![Lucy Looking at Geese](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/lake_lucy_looking_at_gees.jpg)
Lucy was fascinated by the local wildlife, especially these confident geese who seemed just as curious about her.

![Lucy Watching Other Canoe](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/lake_lucy_staring_at_other_canoe.jpg)
Lucy always kept a watchful eye on other watercraft - she took her role as our canoe security very seriously.

![Light Reflection on Water](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/lake_canoe_light_reflection_on_lake.jpg)
The way light danced on the water during our Union Bay paddling adventures created magical moments throughout our Seattle summer.

### Olympic Peninsula Exploration

Ryan attended summer camp in Seattle, making new friends and trying activities he'd never experienced before.

## Feynman's Adventures
Our cat Feynman proved to be quite the traveler, though he had his own way of experiencing the journey.

![Feynman Corner](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/pets_feynmann_corner.jpeg)
Feynman found his favorite corner in every place we stayed.

![Feynman Fled to Tree](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/pets_feymann_fled_to_tree.jpeg)
Sometimes the outdoor adventures were a bit overwhelming for our indoor cat, and he'd seek refuge in the nearest tree.

![Unspoken Bond](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_seattle_summer/pets_so_much_unspoken_between_them.jpeg)
Despite their occasional squabbles at home, Lucy and Feynman developed a deeper understanding during this extended trip. There was so much unspoken communication between them.

## Portland Detour
On our way back, we couldn't resist a quick detour through Portland.

![Wahkeena Falls](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/portlan_wahkeena_falls.jpg)
Wahkeena Falls provided the perfect opportunity to stretch our legs and experience Oregon's natural beauty.

## Our Trusty Travel Companion
![Mercedes in the Mountains](https://datadrivenway.com/media/2025_banff/going_to_the_sun_glc300.jpg)
Our Mercedes GLC 300 was the unsung hero of this entire adventure. When we started the trip, the odometer read around 68,000 miles. By the time we pulled back into our driveway in Irvine, we had reached 73,000 miles - a testament to the 5,000+ miles we covered across multiple states and provinces. 

Throughout the entire journey, from mountain passes to city streets, from washboard roads to highway cruising, the car performed flawlessly. No mechanical issues, no breakdowns, no concerns. It handled the altitude changes, temperature variations, and diverse driving conditions with the reliability we needed for such an ambitious family road trip with pets in tow.

## Reflections on the Road
This trip taught us that the best adventures happen when you're open to the unexpected. From wildlife encounters in Idaho to alpaca farms we never planned to visit, from mountain roads that disappeared into clouds to peaceful lakes that became our temporary home base.

The month and a half we spent on the road changed us as a family. Ryan learned that there's a big, beautiful world beyond our usual routine. Lucy and Feynman learned to adapt and find comfort in new environments. And we learned that home isn't just a place - it's wherever your family is, whether that's in a hotel room in Banff, a cabin by Lake Lucy, or the backseat of a Mercedes climbing mountain roads.

As we pulled back into our driveway in Irvine, those 5,000+ miles on the odometer told only part of the story. The real distance we'd traveled couldn't be measured in miles - it was measured in memories, experiences, and the bonds we strengthened along the way.

Would we do it again? In a heartbeat. The road is calling, and we're already planning our next adventure.
